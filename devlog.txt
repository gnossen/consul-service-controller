We need updates to hostnames to happen very quickly after a resource changes in
kubernetes. This means we'll need a watch operationg ongoing. But we also want
to account for catching up, i.e when the controller startys and several services
already exist. We also want to account for any missed updates due to downtime.
Finally, we need to ensure that updates are sent before the entries time out in
consul.

I think we can solve all of these use cases with two goroutines running
concurrently: one updating deltas according to a watch and the other doing a
state-of-the-world update on a timer.

So I was thinking about only registering services matching an annotation and
also restricting to a set of namespaces. But I don't think that's necessary.
Metallab will operate on anything that is of type LoadBalancer. Why shouldn't I
do somethign similar?

The only potential problem I see is that operating on multiple namespaces and
using just the service name for the DNS entry means that we might have name
clashes. Since we're just doing a stateless fire-and-forget model, that would
mean that the actual DNS entry that won out for competing names would be
nondeterministic. We *could* ignore that problem.

I think the "proper" solution would be namespacing. So service "foo" in
namespace "bar" would be resolveable as "foo.bar" or perhaps "bar.foo". But that
doesn't appeal to me aesthetically. We *could* in addition add just "foo" in
case "foo" is in the deault namespace. This would allow us to avoid name clashes
entirely. I like that one. Let's go with that.

After looking at the built-in controller infrastructure in this repo, I may
actually be able to get rid of my state-of-the-world code. That sort of thing
appears to already be built in. Yay!

Bit of a snag. I've found that the periodic polling I get is an *update*. I
suppose that makes sense. But my update operation was a delete followed by an
add. That's way too much churn. I'm going to have to do this more intelligently,
I think. I'll actually have to store my opinion of the currently stored
endpoints.

Alright. Now we're just on the controller. And everything seems to be working
super smoothly. I can create a service and it's *instantly* available via DNS.
Very nice.
